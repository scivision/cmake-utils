# CMake Utils

CMake is the most powerful and easy to use build system for a wide variety of languages including modern object-oriented Fortran 2018.
It's important to use a recent CMake version; currently we recommend CMake 3.12 or newer.

## Install CMake

* Linux: [cmake_setup.sh](cmake_setup.sh) installs the most recent CMake **without sudo**
* MacOS: `brew install cmake`
* [Windows](https://cmake.org/download/)


## CMake modules

To avoid duplication, we have several scientific computing CMake modules in 
[scivision/fortran-libs](https://github.com/scivision/fortran-libs/tree/master/cmake/Modules) 
repo.
